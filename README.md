# Actor_Critic_Reinforcement_Learning

## Actor-Critic Algorithm

In Actor-Critic algorithms, we simultaneously train an actor (policy) and a critic (value function). The actor guides the agent's actions, and the critic evaluates the state or state-action values.

### Mathematical Formulation

The objective function in Actor-Critic methods can be written as follows:

```latex
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \left( \log \pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t) \cdot A_{\pi_{\theta}}(s_t, a_t) + \beta \cdot V_{\phi}(s_t) \right) \right]
